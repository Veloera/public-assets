**Effective Date:** 27 Jul, 2025

## Introduction
Veloera Public Assets (hereinafter referred to as "the Service") is an independent online platform that provides dynamically updated resources supporting the Veloera open-source ecosystem. These resources include, but are not limited to, automated update scripts, technical documentation, and other public assets designed to assist developers.  

**The Service is not part of the official Veloera project**. It is developed and maintained independently, and **no guarantee is made regarding compatibility or consistency with the official Veloera project**.  

While **certain components of the Service may be integrated within the official Veloera project or related tools**, any use of those components will still require you to review and agree to any terms and conditions that may apply to such usage. By proceeding to use those components, you explicitly consent to the applicable terms.

## Scope of the Service
The Service is publicly accessible, free of charge, and open to individuals, organizations, and commercial entities. It provides resources to support open-source development and integration. We may modify, expand, or discontinue features at our sole discretion and without prior notice.

---

## Acceptable Use
Your use of the Service must remain lawful and responsible. Misuse of the Service is strictly prohibited and includes, but is not limited to:
- Conducting attacks (e.g., DoS/DDoS) or otherwise disrupting Service availability.
- Engaging in excessive automated scraping, flooding, or other abusive traffic patterns.
- Attempting to circumvent security measures, reverse-engineering Service mechanisms, or altering Service behavior.

Violations may result in restriction or termination of access without liability.

---

## Independence and Compatibility Disclaimer
The Service operates independently and is not an official Veloera project component. Although some resources may interact with or be integrated into official Veloera distributions, **we do not guarantee compatibility, stability, or ongoing support for these integrations**. Users are responsible for verifying compatibility in their own environments.

---

## Intellectual Property and Licensing
All resources provided by the Service, including scripts, documentation, and related materials, are owned by Veloera unless otherwise specified. These resources are protected by applicable copyright and intellectual property laws.  

You are granted a **non-exclusive, worldwide, royalty-free license** to download, modify, and redistribute assets under the following conditions:
- Proper attribution must be provided, clearly stating that the resources originate from **Veloera Public Assets**.
- Redistribution must not imply any official endorsement or partnership with Veloera or its affiliates.

No rights are granted to use Veloera trademarks or branding without express written authorization.

---

## Privacy and Data Handling
The Service does not collect personal information. However, as it is hosted on GitHub Pages, GitHub may log access data or process anonymous usage information in accordance with its own privacy policy. By using the Service, you consent to GitHub’s handling of such data.

---

## API Usage
The Service includes APIs designed for anonymous use. Users must limit usage to reasonable levels to avoid service degradation. Excessive or abusive API activity may result in throttling, blocking, or other technical interventions to maintain service stability.

---

## Disclaimer of Warranties
The Service and all associated resources are provided **“AS IS”** and **“AS AVAILABLE”**, without warranties of any kind, whether express or implied. We do not warrant:
- The accuracy, completeness, or reliability of the resources.
- That the Service or its integrations with Veloera will function without interruption or error.
- That resources are free from defects, vulnerabilities, or other risks.

Your use of the Service is at your sole risk.

---

## Limitation of Liability
To the fullest extent permitted by law, Veloera Public Assets and its maintainers shall not be held liable for any damages, whether direct, indirect, incidental, consequential, or otherwise, arising from the use or inability to use the Service. This includes, without limitation, loss of data, business interruption, or compatibility issues with other software.

---

## Common Dispute Scenarios
Disputes may arise over matters such as:
- Attribution failures in redistributed resources.
- Excessive API usage leading to temporary or permanent access restrictions.
- Misinterpretations regarding licensing or use within third-party environments.
- Concerns regarding integration with official Veloera components.

These issues will typically be addressed through informal resolution rather than legal remedies.

---

## Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR)
We believe disputes can and should be resolved without resorting to courts or formal arbitration. **Accordingly, any disagreements related to these Terms or the Service will first be addressed through good-faith negotiations**.  

If direct negotiation is unsuccessful, the parties agree to use **Alternative Dispute Resolution mechanisms**, which may include:
- **Friendly negotiation** through mutual discussion.
- **Mediation** by a neutral third party acceptable to both sides.
- **Community-based arbitration**, where respected members of the open-source community facilitate a resolution process.

These mechanisms are designed to be flexible, collaborative, and cost-effective. All parties agree to attempt these ADR processes in good faith before pursuing any other form of resolution.

---

## Modifications to the Terms
We may revise these Terms at any time without notice. Updates take effect immediately upon publication. Continued use of the Service following such changes constitutes acceptance of the updated Terms.

---

## Entire Agreement
These Terms of Service constitute the entire agreement between you and Veloera Public Assets, superseding any prior representations or agreements. No waiver of any provision shall be construed as a waiver of any other provision.
