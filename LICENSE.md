## Introduction
Veloera Public Assets (hereinafter referred to as "the Service") is an independent online platform providing dynamically updated resources that complement the Veloera open-source ecosystem. These resources include automated update scripts, technical documentation, and other public assets designed to assist developers.  

**The Service is not part of the official Veloera project**. It is developed and maintained independently, and **there is no guarantee of compatibility or consistency with the official Veloera project or its releases**. Use of the Service is voluntary, and by continuing to use it, you agree to these Terms of Service ("Terms").

---

## Scope of the Service
The Service is publicly accessible without registration and is provided free of charge. It is intended to promote open-source usage and innovation, allowing both personal and commercial utilization of the provided resources.

The Service may evolve over time, and features or resources may be added, modified, or removed without notice. We also reserve the right to apply technical safeguards to ensure stable operations.

## Acceptable Use
Users must use the Service lawfully and responsibly. **Prohibited behaviors** include, but are not limited to:  
- Overloading the Service infrastructure through excessive automated queries or abusive traffic patterns.  
- Engaging in attacks, including DoS/DDoS, exploitation of vulnerabilities, or attempts to bypass security measures.

- Using the Service for illegal purposes or to violate applicable laws.

Violations may result in immediate suspension or termination of access.

## Independence from the Official Veloera Project
The Service operates independently and is not an official part of the Veloera project. While it may provide assets related to Veloera, **we make no representations or warranties that these assets will remain compatible with or supported by the official Veloera project**. Users should exercise caution when integrating assets and must independently verify compatibility with their environments.

## Intellectual Property and Licensing
All resources provided through the Service, including scripts, documentation, and other materials, are owned by Veloera unless otherwise indicated. These assets are licensed under a permissive, non-exclusive license granting you the right to download, modify, and redistribute them.

No license is granted to use the Veloera trademarks, logos, or branding without express written permission.

## Privacy and Data Handling
The Service does not collect personal information. However, because the Service is hosted on GitHub Pages, GitHub may log access data in accordance with its privacy policies. By using the Service, you acknowledge that GitHub may process limited anonymous data.

## API Usage
The Service provides APIs that can be used anonymously. To ensure fair access, users must refrain from excessive or abusive usage patterns. High-volume automated traffic may be throttled or blocked to protect the integrity of the Service.

## Limitation of Liability
To the maximum extent permitted by law, we shall not be held liable for any damages, including but not limited to loss of data, business interruption, loss of profits, or other consequential damages arising from use of or inability to use the Service.

---

## Common Dispute Scenarios
Disputes may arise regarding attribution, service availability, licensing interpretations, or user conduct. Most issues can be resolved informally through communication. We explicitly state that we do not provide any monetary compensation or assume liability for such disputes.

---

## Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR)
We prefer to resolve disputes without involving courts or formal arbitration. **Any disagreements related to these Terms or the use of the Service shall first be addressed through good-faith discussions** between the parties.  

If informal negotiation fails, disputes may proceed to alternative mechanisms, including but not limited to:
- **Friendly negotiation** between involved parties.
- **Mediation** by an independent neutral party agreed upon by both sides.
- **Community-based arbitration** involving respected members of the open-source community to provide a non-binding resolution.

These ADR mechanisms are intended to resolve conflicts efficiently, respectfully, and without legal proceedings. You agree to pursue these steps before considering any legal action.

---

## Modifications to the Terms
We may revise these Terms at any time without prior notice. Updated versions will become effective immediately upon publication. Your continued use of the Service constitutes acceptance of the latest version.

---

## Entire Agreement
These Terms represent the entire agreement between you and the Veloera Public Assets Service, superseding any prior discussions or agreements. No waiver of any provision shall constitute a waiver of any other provision.
